                    I began my coding journey at Lviv Polytechnic University. I was studying Applicable Linguistics and we had some coding classes, however, they weren't as good as I thought they would be. In those classes, we were coding mostly in Pascal programming language which isn't the best option in today's world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I've decided to move in this direction on my own. I've started watching YouTube tutorials on how to learn to code and quickly picked up Python because a lot of people online recommended it as the first programming language as it is easy to learn and is known for its English-like syntax. So I went online and found 'A Python course for beginners on 'Stepik'
                    (course platform similar to Udemy). So at free from university time, I was taking this course. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then I had to leave Ukraine. I moved to the small town of Bia≈Çogard in Poland in the summer of 2022 and had to find a job. I was working 10 hours, five days a week, and studying on weekends. After I finished this Python course I found the Harvard CS50 course that covered the basics of computer science and was using C language as well as Python and JavaScript but half of the course was in C unfortunately&#40;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I decided to move to Warsaw and find a job that allowed me to focus more on programming. I finished the CS50 course at the end of spring 2023 and started making my own projects using frameworks like Flask, ReactJS, and Django which you can see on this website.
